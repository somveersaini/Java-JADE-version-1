This is a project I have created for my university Intelligent Agents module. 
It is written in Java and requires JADE framework to work.

The project implements 3 types of agents: Broker, Client and Supplier.
Agents trade in things like nuts and bolts.

- Broker: special agent that introduces Clients to Suppliers. All negotiations 
happen directly between Client and Supplier afterwards.

- Supplier: sells.

- Client: buys
